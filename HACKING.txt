We need to agresively test Novacut with a large number of real files from HDSLR
cameras.  However, we don't want to put these files themselves under version
control as we don't want the tree to be hundreds of GB.  The solution is to use
dmedia to store the test files.  This will be done soon, but for now, here is
how to get the needed test files:

    mkdir ~/.novacut-test-files
    cd ~/.novacut-test-files
    wget http://uds-o.novacut.com/NPY3IW5SQJUNSP2KV47GVB24G7SWX6XF.mov
    wget http://uds-o.novacut.com/ENN6AVN2M42ZQULASQNKTTDISIL3YKHE.mov
