                         ***************************

Getting Started
===============

Work on Novacut is coordinated through its Launchpad project:

    https://launchpad.net/novacut

Interested developers should start by installing `novacut` from the Novacut
Daily Builds PPA (which is also an easy way to get all the dependencies).

Install from the daily PPA like this:

    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:novacut/daily
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install novacut


Grab the Code
=============

Install `bzr` if you don't already have it installed:

    sudo apt-get install bzr

Then setup your bzr workspace and checkout novacut trunk like this:

    bzr init-repo novacut
    cd novacut/
    bzr checkout lp:novacut trunk
    cd trunk/

Then run the unit tests, which is a good way to make sure things are setup
appropriately for development:

    ./setup.py test

If you need help, ping jderose in the #novacut IRC channel.


Coding Style
============

Contributions must follow good PEP-8, PEP-257 style:
